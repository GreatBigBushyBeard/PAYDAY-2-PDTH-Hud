Currently this addons folder can be used to add new portraits to PDTH Hud.

Look at the 'test.txt' as an example of some of the variables, you can also look at 'og_hoxton.json' to see a fully setup Portrait addition.

For the file to work it MUST have the extension 'json' if it doesn't it will not work.
